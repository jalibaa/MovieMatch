### Project Description
[Our project is a movie suggestion website that helps users select films based on their genre preferences for both solo and group watching scenarios. It simplifies decision-making by offering tailored recommendations and resolving group conflicts through random selection.
]

### The Problem statement
[Choosing a movie can be surprisingly frustrating, especially when trying to agree with friends. People often spend more time browsing than watching movies.

### The Solution
[We provide a simple platform where users can select their genre preferences for both solo and group scenarios, generating customized movie recommendations. In group cases, if preferences clash, a random suggestion resolves conflicts.
